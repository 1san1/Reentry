***Help Wanted***

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***Notice*** 
I'm working on making an orginisation, FearlessTech, that this repo will be transfered to. Hopefully, I will compleate this today. If you are a contributor to this site and would like to become a collaborator, submit some work a few times. After, I see/trust your experiance level, I'll send you a invite from the org.

This site is being built for Maine Community of reentry advocates and/or anyone who concerns themselves with sucsesfull prisoner reintergration. [NAMI](https://www.namimaine.org/) and [MPRN](https://re-entrymaine.org/) are both non-profit orginizations that fully involved in prisoner reentry. They have agreed to maintain this site after it is launched.  

I am a Tech student / Jr Full Stack Developer. I'm hoping to find some willing developers to donate some of there time and experiance to help me build this website for a worthy cause. This website will help thousands of Maine's Prisoners have a more successful reentry back into society. 

If you would like to contribute, just comment on an issue and I will assign it to you. If you see something you would like to fix, make an issue.
